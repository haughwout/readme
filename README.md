README
======

This is the account I used for access to our codebase at CustomMade ventures. 
It has no public repos--other than our open sourced work at https://github.com/sawdustsoftware/

CustomMade.com is primarily built on Django and uses a large (and growing) set of open source technologies.

We are seeking great engineers to expand our platform.
