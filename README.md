This is the account I used for access to our codebase at CustomMade ventures. It has no public repos--other than our open sourced work at https://github.com/sawdustsoftware/

CustomMade.com is primarily built on Django and uses a large (and growing) set of open source technologies.

We are seeking great engineers (Python Backenders, HTML5/CSS3/JS Front Enders, DevOps and BigData/Search/Knowledge Graph engineers to expand our platform. See http://www.custommade.com/careers/ for more
